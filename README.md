INSTRUCTIONS on how to run the analysis.
All the analysis is performed in a unique script, named run_analysis.R

To produce the tidy_data.txt file, please run the run_analysis.R script and the file will be produced
in your working directory. 
The script produces also a dataframe with the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject, named "meandf".
